# The Horseland Game: Backend

Ruby on Rails JSON API backend for a modern send-up to the mid-90's version of the Horseland Game. No relationship or official connection to the current or former Horseland game, other than for inspiration.

## Setup and Install

As per any basic Rails install: clone the repo and run migrations (`rake db:setup` will get things up and running with some starter users and horses.)

The app's CORS settings are currently set to any domain, so you may wish to change that to specify your specific front-end URL.

## Tests

Test suite is written in RSpec, so use `rspec` to run it.
